# Mapping Earthquakes

## Applications and Sources Used Used

An individual account was created on Mapbox (https://www.mapbox.com/) to generate and API to render maps on the browser.  Leaflet, an open-source JavaScript library (https://leafletjs.com/), was used to create layers on the map such as streets and satelitte images.  Data for recent earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes came from the following sources:
- USGS GeoJSON Data for All Earthquakes from the Past Seven Days:  https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson
- Tectonic Plate Boundaries from a GitHub User:  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json
- Major Earthquake (Magnitude of 4.5 or More) Data from the Past Seven Days:
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson
